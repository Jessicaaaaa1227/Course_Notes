# Afternoon Class

### Video

From the video, we learned how Iron Man has the greatest abilities. First, he must perceive the characteristics of the hit, such as the speed and distance. Second, he will estimate the extent of the danger of the hit. Third, he reacts to the hit according to previous training.

### Supervised Learning

Each variable/features(x) has a response variable(y). It can predict y value upon the x value.

### Pipeline (2 Stages)

(1) Data --> Process --> Machine Learning --> Packtest

    Given x and y, we are able to build a function f such that y hat = f(x). Hence, "Educated Guess" is accurate.

(2) Input new data --> Blackbox: any machine learrning algorithms --> Predict/Forecast

Examples: Linear Regression or Logistic Regression or Neural Network.

### Regression or Classification

We learned something about discrete and continuous data, as well as the differences of regression and classification. If Y is countinuous, regression can be used to predict Y. Otherwise, classfication should be used to predict Y.

### R

We learned how to download R project and R studio (IDE). After that, we also learned its grammar, which is quite different from python. For example, we use list or array to store a group of numbers in Python, but we use c (short for "concantenate") in R. Also, we need to pay attention to dimension when using c I am really looking forward to visualizing data in R.
