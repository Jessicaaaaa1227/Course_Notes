### Video [link]{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKl4-zC1WZs} 

From the video, we learned how Iron Man collects data. The first one is "Hit", so we can know the characteristics, such as speed and distance. 
The second one is "Training". From the training data, we have x (independent features/variables) and y(target).
The third one is "Action", so Iron Man will either choose to step aside or block himself.

### Supervised Learning

Given explanatory variable(x) and response variable (y). The machine may learn from x and predict y.

### Pipeline (2 Stages)

(1) Data --> Process --> Machine Learning --> Packtest

    Given x and y, we are able to build a function f such that y hat = f(x). Hence, "Educated Guess" is accurate.

(2) Input new data --> Blackbox: any machine learrning algorithms --> Predict/Forecast

Examples: Linear Regression or Logistic Regression or Neural Network.

### Regression or Classification

We also learned something about not only quantitive data (discrete and continuous) but also the differences of regression and classification. Specifically, we use regression to predict Y if it's continuous, and classification to predict Y if it's discrete. 
(Hint: X can be either continuous and discrete, it doesn't matter.)

### R

We learned how to download R project and R studio (IDE). After that, we also learned its grammar, which is quite different from python. For example, we use list or array to store a group of numbers in Python, but we use c (short for "concantenate") in R. Also, we need to pay attention to dimension when using c I am really looking forward to visualizing data in R.
