# Afternoon Class

### Video

From the video, we learned how Iron Man collects data. The first one is "Hit", so we can know the characteristics, such as speed and distance. 
The second one is "Training". From the training data, we have x (independent features/variables) and y(target).
The third one is "Action". Iron Man will either choose to step aside or block himself.

### Supervised Learning

Given explanatory variable(x) and response variable (y). The machine may learn from x and predict y.

### Pipeline (2 Stages)

(1) Data --> Process --> Machine Learning --> Packtest

    Given x and y, we are able to build a function f such that y hat = f(x). Hence, "Educated Guess" is accurate.

(2) Input new data --> Blackbox: any machine learrning algorithms --> Predict/Forecast

Example: Linear Regression or Logistic Regression or Neural Network.

### Regression or Classification

We use regression to predict Y is continuous (from certain range, you can have any number) or classification to predict y is discrete (finite possibility).

(Hint: X can be either continuous and discrete, it doesn't matter.)

### R

We learned how to download R project and R studio (IDE). After that, we also learned its grammar.

#### Example:
